    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implemented several algorithms in C++ and tested correctness.
        % This sounds generic. Make it more specific. E.g. "I was assigned with problems like 'Insert brief problem description'. To make sure I found the right solution I wrote tests that ensured the algorithm correctness by 'insert brief description of how the tests worked.' In addition, I had to make sure that the solution was scalable and that it could be used by other faculty members". 
        \item Analysed performance of algorithms with synthetic datasets.
        % Same as above
